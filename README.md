## About:
### Techs used:
- ReactJS;
- Redux;
- React Router;
- TailwindCSS.

### How I used React:
This project was created using `create-react-app`, I choosed this way because my point was exercise the reactÂ´s basement. 

### How I used Router:
My App-clone is divided in 5 pages: Home, Search, List, Originals and Catalog. Here are the routes:
- `'/'` - _Home page_ 
- `'/search'` - _Search page _
- `'/list'` - _List page _
- `'/originals'` - _Originals page _
- `'/catalog'` -  _Catalog page _


### How I used Redux:

![Store (1)](https://github.com/PedroHy/disney-plus-react-clone/assets/62411379/d3a2383c-4042-447f-8c5e-3924db86fb9a)

I used just three states in this project: movies, categories and banners, who are inside of a _store_. 

### TailwindCSS:

This was the first project where I used Tailwind, It was a little challenging, but I loved the framework and I will use in other projects!

### API:

I used has an API a folder that contains pictures, videos and a JSON file.
